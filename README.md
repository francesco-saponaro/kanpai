## Overview
This is a practice application I have completed following the [MERN Stack Full Ecommerce Site - Using React, Redux, Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/course/mern-stack-ecommerce-site-using-react-redux-nodejs/) Udemy course, in which I have learned the required MERN skills to build an E-commerce application.
I have also took this opportunity to learn how to test the API/HTTP requests with Postman and to test MongoDB's CRUD operations with the Mocha test framework.

If you would like to test run the website and have fun with the features without having to create an account, you can use this admin account:
