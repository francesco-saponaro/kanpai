Jota Tanaka, Kirin Whisky's Master Blender, shows us once again how to achieve a perfect balance between light and cereal notes, and rich and intense aromas. This aromatic harmony is achieved through the blending of three types of grain whiskies : a light type (distilled in column stills), a medium (distilled in Batch Kettle still) and an intense one (distilled in Double Still, a worldwide specificity outside the lands of Bourbon).",

The first one is that it is composed of a subtle mix of single malts from Chichibu and Hanyu distilleries, but also of single malts from Scotland. This makes it one of the rare whiskies that gives the possibility to taste whisky from the Hanyu distillery founded by Ichiro Akuto's grandfather and definitively closed.",
